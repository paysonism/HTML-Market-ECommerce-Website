# Payson's Market

This is an HTML ecommerce/market website. This is a glassmorphism design without any animations. You can add animations to make ts look clean ash tho.

Uses a script to have pre-specefied product descriptions and information set into identifiers and then uses one product page and changes the details on that page to match the given id used. Idk how to explain it but its a pretty good system you can use to have them redirected to the stripe pages or whatever.
